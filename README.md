# handwritten_data_recognition_from_live_video
Handwritten data recognition from live video from webcam using open cv and KNN classifier. contains the dataset on which model is trained and the code for fitting the classifier and doing the evaluation.
The only file in this repo contains the code for training the model and the evaluation. The evaluation will start automatically once the training is successful. You will notice that your webcam starts automatically when the training is finished, place the data to be evaluated infront of the camera and the result will show. 

You can also use it to recognise sentences and words by extending the code. Some changes have to be made. But i am not doing it here.
